### Hello!
I've recently finished my Bachelor's Thesis which has been focused on biological age estimation from retinal fundus images and eye-tracking signals. In this repository, I have published the definitive artificial neural network models which I have used:
  - The 2D convolutional neural network used for biological age estimation from retinal fundus images
  - The 1D convolutional neural network used for biological age estimation from eye-tracking signals
